# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a **lightweight**, **interpreted**, or **just-in-time compiled** programming language with **first-class functions**. It is best known as the scripting language for **web pages**, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well such as **Node.js**, **React Native**, **Apache CouchDB**, and **Adobe Acrobat**.

It is one of the **core technologies** of the World Wide Web, alongside **HTML** and **CSS**. As of today, **98% of websites** use JavaScript for client-side functionality.

## 🌟 Why JavaScript is Important

### 1. **Core Web Technology**
JavaScript is one of the three main technologies in web development:
- **HTML** (Structure)
- **CSS** (Styling)
- **JavaScript** (Interactivity & Logic)

Without JavaScript, web pages would be static and non-interactive.

### 2. **Runs Everywhere**
JavaScript can be run:
- In the **browser** (frontend)
- On **servers** (using Node.js)
- On **mobile apps** (via React Native or Ionic)
- In **desktop apps** (Electron.js)

### 3. **Huge Ecosystem**
- Millions of libraries and frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, jQuery
- Package management via **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- Active and global developer community

### 4. **High Demand in Industry**
JavaScript is consistently ranked as one of the **top programming languages** for job opportunities worldwide.
