# How to Add Comments in JavaScript

Comments are lines in your code that are **ignored by the JavaScript engine**. They are used to explain, document, or temporarily disable code, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

## Types of Comments in JavaScript

### 1. Single-line Comments

- Start with `//`
- Everything after `//` on the same line is treated as a comment.

#### Example:

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // You can also add comments after a statement
