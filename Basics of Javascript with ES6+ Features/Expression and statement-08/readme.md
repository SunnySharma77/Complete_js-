## What is an Expression?

An **expression** is a unit of code that **produces a value**. It can be as simple as a number or a string, or more complex like a function call or a combination of variables and operators.

### âœ… Examples of Expressions:

```javascript
42                  // a number literal (expression)
"x + y"             // an addition expression (if x and y are defined)
3 * (4 + 5)          // returns 27
myFunction(5)        // function call returning a value
isLoggedIn === true  // comparison expression
