# Statements and Semicolons in JavaScript

## What is a Statement?

A **statement** in JavaScript is a **complete instruction** that the JavaScript engine can execute. It represents an action, such as declaring a variable, calling a function, or making a decision.

### Examples of statements:
```javascript
let x = 5;           // Variable declaration statement
console.log(x);      // Function call statement
if (x > 3) {         // Control flow statement (if)
  console.log("Yes");
}
